# How-much-will-a-student-earn-after-college
The aim of the project is to visualize how much does a student earns based on his majors during college. <br>
Worked with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. <br>
The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data.
FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo. <br>
